<p class="Body"><strong>Requires:</strong> LIBSSH2</p>
<p class="Body">Represents a connection to a SSH agent application. A SSH agent application stores usernames, public/private key pairs, and passwords/passphrases to make managing and using multiple "identities" for multiple remote SSH servers.

Identities are stored in memory as a linked list. This class provides functionality for obtaining the linked list and transversing the linked list of identities.</p>

This VI allocates memory within the libssh2lv shared library that must be explicitly deallocated, or freed, at the end of the application using the <strong>Destroy</strong> VI to avoid memory leaks or running Out-of-Memory (OOM) on a resource contrained system.
