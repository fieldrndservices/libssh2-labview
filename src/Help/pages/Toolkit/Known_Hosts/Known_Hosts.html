<td class="Bordered">Creates a new Known Hosts object that represents a libssh2lv shared library Known Hosts struct. This VI must be called, or executed, before using any other Known Hosts-related VIs. This VI allocates memory within the libssh2lv shared library that must be explicitly deallocated, or freed, at the end of the application using the <strong>Destroy</strong> VI to avoid memory leaks or running Out-of-Memory (OOM) on a resource contrained system.
A Known Hosts object represents a linked list of entries in a known hosts file on the local host.</td>

<td class="Bordered">Deallocates, or frees, the memory allocated for the libssh2lv shared library Known Hosts struct represented by this Known Hosts object. After this is called, the object can no longer be used in the application without causing a segmentation fault, i.e. crashing LabVIEW. This VI must be called to avoid leaking memory or running Out-of-Memory (OOM) on resource-constrained systems.</td>
